Starting Scheduler Validation Demo (DEMO_ID=10)

************************************************
*** REALISTIC SCHEDULER VALIDATION DEMO ***
************************************************
This demo demonstrates Rate Monotonic scheduling
with realistic computational workloads and precise
execution time measurements.

Task Configuration:
- HIGH Priority (4): Light load, 100ms period
- MEDIUM Priority (3): Medium load, 200ms period
- LOW Priority (2): Heavy load, 500ms period
