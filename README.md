# Thesis: Analysis of Performance and Verification of Real-Time Operating System on RISC-V Architecture

## Overview
This repository contains the work related to my thesis on the analysis of performance and verification of a real-time operating system (RTOS) on the RISC-V architecture. The work includes theoretical analysis, practical implementation, and experimental evaluation of RTOS performance using FreeRTOS on RISC-V platforms.

## Repository Structure
- **Documentation**: Contains thesis document drafts and related materials.
- **Code**: Contains practical implementations and experimental work.
- **Resources**: Contains relevant literature and reference materials.

## Objectives
- Analyze key RTOS concepts including task management, memory management, synchronization, and IPC mechanisms.
- Perform mathematical analysis of execution time and deterministic behavior.
- Conduct experimental evaluation of RTOS performance on RISC-V platform.

## Initial Commit
This initial commit includes the thesis proposal and preliminary research materials.
